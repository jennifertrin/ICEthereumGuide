# Internet Computer Guide for Ethereum Developers

👋 Welcome to the Internet Computer Developer Ecosystem! 

This guide provides an overview of how Ethereum developers can utilize the [Internet Computer (ICP)](https://internetcomputer.org/). 

## 👩‍💻 Introduction

The Internet Computer allows Web3 services to run 100% on-chain, providing the only platform where developers can build and users can enjoy fully decentralized applications. ICP ditches corporate cloud, insecure bridges and expensive oracles.

Currently, Ethereum applications find themselves in a partially decentralized state, using a smart contracts and web2 technology to function. The Internet Computer provides Ethereum developers with the infrastructure to complete decentralization without compromising on user experience, app performance, or development time.

ICP can operate as a standalone layer-1 blockchain or as a highly efficient scalability infrastructure that can complement existing Ethereum projects.

The flexibility enables Ethereum developers to develop new completely decentralized applications or integrate decentralized components into existing applications. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

This guide is divided into three sections:

## 1. Terminology and Concept Comparisons

We'll demystify key terminologies and concepts within ICP, and outline any key differences between Ethereum and ICP (they are minimal, we promise!).

## 2. Hands-On Tutorials

It's time to roll up your sleeves and dive into the action! Our hands-on tutorials will guide you through the process of building on the ICP vs. Ethereum. 

## 2. Examples Projects

We'll showcase a variety of final example projects from the hands-on tutorials. 

## ✨ How to Contribute

**Feature Your Ethereum Product**: If you have a product built on Ethereum that you'd like to showcase to the ICP community, share it with us by opening an issue or filling out this [form](https://forms.gle/BmQExp6axdUQCMFt6).

**Request Ethereum x ICP Integration**: For any integration requests involving Ethereum and ICP, open an issue and let us know your ideas.

**Share Updates**: Have any other updates or contributions? Feel free to open a PR or issue.
