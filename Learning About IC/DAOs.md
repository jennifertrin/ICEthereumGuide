# üè¢ DAOs on Ethereum vs. ICP

Decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) are collectives that are governed by community-based voting. 

Imagine a Twitter without Elon Musk, where active, real creators and users make all of the decisions about the platform development and management through voting.

In the age of the Internet, platform users and creators are subject to platform policies that limit data protection and monetization. They have little to no say on how the profits made off of their content and data are used towards. 

DAOs enable users and creators to help the platforms that they use to make the best decisions on product, development, and monetization. 

DAOs exist that govern everything from a financial application (ex. Uniswap DAO, Maker DAO) to a media agency (ex. Bankless DAO) to a social application (ex. OpenChat, Decentraland DAO). The data of DAOs from the user identities to the voting are usually stored on the blockchain. 

In this article, we‚Äôll compare how DAOs are created and structured on Ethereum and the Internet Computer. 

To start, here is a comparison between the terminology used to describe smart contracts and concepts related to them:

## **Terminology Comparer Overview**

| Ethereum | Internet Computer |

| Decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) | Service Nervous System (SNS) |

## ü™Ñ Creating a DAO

On **Ethereum**, DAOs do not follow a standard framework. Some DAOs follow legal frameworks set in Colorado and Wyoming. 

Many proclaimed DAOs act more like community organizations and are not completely decentralized or follow any framework at the start.

Members of Ethereum-based DAOs usually post proposals on a forum platform such as Discourse and then vote on them on a voting platform such as Snapshot. They usually store their funds in a multi-signature wallet which requires x amount of members to approve a transaction before funds are released. 

Anyone can create a DAO on Ethereum at any time. 

On the **Internet Computer**, the Service Nervous System (SNS) serves as a standard framework for DAOs. 

An SNS creator must seek approval from the NNS DAO, the Internet Computer DAO, to launch a DAO. This ensures that founders have developed a thorough plan to ensure the success of the DAO and the protection of users from common DAO issues (including scams, whales taking over voting power, etc.). 

Users looking to join DAOs can ensure that DAOs launched on IC are fully vetted and mature enough to take on new members. 

On the **Internet Computer**, the NNS DAO will expect the following from a proposal to launch an SNS:

- DAO token utility including tokenomics
- Initial token allocation
- Voting power
- Funding target
- Technical architecture
- Project roadmap
- Whitepaper
- Any disclosures

üí° Why would I go through all of these steps to establish a DAO on the Internet Computer when I can create a DAO on Ethereum right away?

Creating a well-functioning DAO with a proper governance model requires a lot of thought and time. The SNS on the Internet Computer provides a framework of the technical and financial requirements needed to launch a successful DAO. 

In addition, utilizing the technical template of the SNS ensures that all aspects of your DAO, from proposals to voting to financial execution, are decentralized and on-chain.
