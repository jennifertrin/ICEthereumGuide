# üëõ Wallets on Ethereum vs. ICP

A blockchain wallet is a digital wallet or program that stores cryptocurrencies. 

A blockchain wallet is assigned a wallet address, a unique identifier similar to a bank account number. Users use their blockchain wallet to access and use decentralized applications. A wallet address is often used to identify users, though a user can have more than one wallet.

## üí° Purpose of a Wallet

On **Ethereum**, users deposit cryptocurrency in their wallets to pay for gas or usage fees within applications. 

On the **Internet Computer**, users also create a wallet to connect to an application. However, unlike Ethereum, users are not required to deposit cryptocurrency to access and utilize applications. The canisters or smart contracts on the applications pay for the gas fees. 

On both chains, smart contract developers must deposit cryptocurrency into their wallets to deploy smart contracts.

## ü™Ñ How to Create a Wallet

On **Ethereum**, the most popular wallet providers are [Metamask](https://metamask.io/), [Argent](https://www.argent.xyz/), and [Coinbase Wallet](https://www.coinbase.com/wallet). 

When setting up a wallet, you need to store a series of phrases or ‚Äúseed phrase‚Äù for recovery and generate a password.

You must also generate a password to create the wallet. 

On the **Internet Computer**, you can log into applications without a seed phrase or password by creating a digital identity at **https://identity.ic0.app/**. Optionally, you can add a recovery phrase or device.

For storing cryptocurrencies, consider using **[Stoic](https://www.stoicwallet.com/)** or **[Bitfinity Wallet](https://wallet.bitfinity.network/)**.
